## Why I Chose This Issue

I was looking through the provided list of issues with tech stacks I have experience in. I found this project which uses two technologies I'm very familiar with (JS and CSS), and a technology that I was familiar with a long time ago where I could use a refresher.

The issue was in a cluster of issues from the same repository. Most of these other issues had many times more occurrences of the specified issue. This one only has two occurrences (and really after looking into it, really could be considered just one occurence). That seems managable and completable in the time alotted.

## Understanding the Issue

### Problem Description

A React component contains a div with the onMouseOver and onMouseOut props that toggle the active state. React Doctor is a tool which detects anti-patterns in React apps. One of the uses seems to be identifying accessibility issues like this where a mouse is assumed when that is not necessarily a tool a user has the ability of using. Thus, we need to add the corresponding keyboard versions of onMouseOver and onMouseOut so the functionality is identical when using the component with a keyboard.

### Expected Behavior

Mousing on and off the div should result in the same behavior (the toggling of the active state) as focusing and unfocusing the div using a keyboard.

### Current Behavior

Focusing and unfocusing the div using a keyboard never toggles the active state. 

### Affected Components

This impacts the `validation-error-boundary.tsx` component which is located at `admin.flow-builder-core.v1/components/validation-panel/validation-error-boundary.tsx`.
